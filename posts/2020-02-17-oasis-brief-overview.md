Oasis protocol is a decentralized privacy-preserving platform for cloud computing that allows safe data sharing and ownership enabling computationally complex applications. Oasis provides confidentiality at every layer of the protocol. The network is secured by proof-of-stake where the rectitude of validators responsible for consensus and nodes providing computations is provided by slashing in case of misbehavior. At the outset, validators are incentivized by gradually decreasing emission schedule and transaction fees.

### Current state and market potential

Oasis team plans to launch on mainnet soon after the incentivized testnet "Quest", which is currently ongoing with 85 participants and will end in Q1 2020.

[Gartner projects](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-04-02-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-g) the market size and growth of the cloud services industry at nearly three time the growth of overall IT services by 2022. According to [IDC forecast](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45340719) worldwide spending on public cloud services and infrastructure is set to double growing from $229 billion in 2019 to almost $500 billion by 2023.

At the same time more data is stored in the clouds posing higher security and privacy risks which are the most concerning for data owners. The danger of cloud breach [has increased by 18.4% since 2016 while 60% of companies](https://leftronic.com/cloud-computing-statistics/) use cloud technology to store confidential data.

Oasis team addressed privacy issues by implementing[ Ekiden](https://docsend.com/view/3aznduk) that allows nodes to perform computations off-chain in a trusted execution environment without access to the data itself.

### Token allocation and purpose

Oasis Labs raised $45 million. The overall token allocation is currently not available and will be published by the project team later.

Oasis native token is a staking unit with limited liquidity and low volatility serving the purpose of securing the network and incentivizing nodes to follow the protocol rules. Transaction fees are also denominated in native token as well as a payment for provided computations after this feature will be enabled.

There will be no public sale due to regulation risks. To acquire tokens you should wait for official announcements from the Oasis team and listing on exchanges.

### Staking economics

Oasis currently uses Tendermint consensus. Nodes performing confidential computations utilize TEEs to execute smart contracts and do not have access to the data itself while validators finalize transactions and update the state of the blockchain. Oasis network will launch with a focus on the consensus layer of the protocol. **To begin with, rewards from staking will be 15% and then gradually decrease to 10%** by the end of the year. Holders can delegate their funds increasing overall security of the network and earn a share of rewards in proportion to their stake. There is a minimum required delegation of 100 tokens. Staking since the beginning of mainnet will result in higher returns for delegators.

### Slashing risks

At the time of mainnet launch, the protocol will slash **only for double-signing**. At the start the **minimum amount of 100 tokens will be slashed** and node functioning stopped in order to prevent the node from being over-penalized and resulting in losing delegations. Validators will have to change operating address and attract delegations to participate in consensus. There is **no slash for liveness or uptime at launch**, but a node would need to sign at least 75% of blocks in the epoch to receive corresponding rewards.

### About P2P Validator

[P2P Validator](https://p2p.org) is a world-leading non-custodial staking provider securing more than $200 million trusted by over 2000 delegators across 15+ top-notch networks. Our team has close connections with Oasis team and we have participated in the incentivized testnet since the beginning. P2P Validator invested its own funds in Oasis project in 2018 and intends to support the network in the long term.
