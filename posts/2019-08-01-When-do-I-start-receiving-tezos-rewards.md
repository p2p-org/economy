> Enjoy our first light-weight post of [Eli5 series](https://economy.p2p.org/category/Eli5/) covering a reward distribution in Tezos blockchain in a form of comic-strip style story. 

John has some Tezos tokens and wants to receive rewards. He takes them to a baker*, P2P Validator.

John makes an agreement to delegate his tokens to P2P Validator and becomes a delegator. 
John’s delegating step by step you can see [here](https://p2p.org/tezos#delegating).

The tokens remain in John’s wallet, but the staking balance of P2P Validator increases.

P2P Validator bakes John’s tokens for 7 cycles (typically 21 days).

After 7 cycles John can see on P2P Dashboard by how much his tokens have grown.

At this point his rewards will still be pending for another 5 cycles (typically 15 days).

It worked! 
John started getting rewards on his KT address as soon the 12th cycle was completed (typically 36-37day). The delegating process continues afresh and compounds automatically, so John’s reward tokens work with his original stake to increase his rewards in the next cycle.

P2P Validator receives 9.95% validator fee and uses it to pay for:
server time & running costs
building better infrastructure 
24/7 technical support

P2P Validator is part of a tezos network, which is a decentralised one. There are many validators (bakers) in the network and each one makes their own decision on what fees to charge. If a fee is too low there is a risk to the baking process. 
We believe in charging a fair fee for a good service.

In our next story you will learn how to redelegate (change a baker) and how to stop the delegation.
