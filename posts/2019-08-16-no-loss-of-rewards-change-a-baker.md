Arthur is having dinner with Kate, a colleague from work. They get on very well and talk about a lot of things about themselves.  They discover they both have the same opinion about banks - they are crypto-enthusiasts.

Arthur and Kate share their experiences with PoS tokens. They both love Tezos as an up-and-coming network. 

Arthur: Who is your delegator? I have been with P2P Validator since 2018. I love their intuitive dashboard - I can see my rewards and rewards history at a glance.

Kate: Oh, I really struggle to find out my rewards. My delegator is terrible at keeping me in the loop. I discovered they didn’t pay my rewards on time or in full. It’s a real headache. 

A: Be carefull, maybe in future they may not pay at all. Why not change? It's really simple.

K: Won't I lose my rewards while I’m redelegating?

A: No, your rewards from your old baker must be paid to you in full even when you stop baking completely. If you redelegate, your new baker will start to pay your rewards automatically when they are due. 

K: That sounds great! How do I get started?

A: It’s easy, just follow these simple steps:

K: Do you recommend that I choose P2P Validator?

A: Absolutely. They are extremely efficient, have a great track record and only charge a fair validator fee.

K: You’ve sold them to me. How about coming up for a cup of coffee and help me to do it now.

A: This will be the beginning of a beautiful relationship!
