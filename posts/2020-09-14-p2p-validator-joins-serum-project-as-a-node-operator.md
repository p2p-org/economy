This year has been marked by the surge of decentralized finance (DeFi) and rise of a value locked through Uniswap - an automated market maker. Despite this, notable limitations like slow transaction processing, a spike in gas prices and the absence of trustless cross-chain swaps still exist, aggravating user experience.

Serum is going to eliminate these limitations of DeFi space. It is a **trustless decentralized exchange by design** built on top of Solana blockchain implying low latency and high transaction speed. Serum has **cross-chain support** and does not rely on centralized price feeds. **It is fully interoperable with Ethereum ecosystem** and provides the same trading experience that users get on centralized platforms by being the first high-throughput exchange that has a fully **on-chain orderbook and matching engine**.

Due to impressive performance qualities **Serum can become a foundational block for DeFi**.

*With that in mind, P2P Validator is thrilled to announce the launch of Serum node with the mission of fostering DeFi growth and supporting censorship-resistance of value exchange.* 

Our team has extensive experience in setting up secure infrastructure. **P2P Validator maintains high-availability nodes and provides secure staking services for the most groundbreaking projects in the blockchain space**. We are an early Solana investor and active contributor operating a robust validator for mainnet beta. The node infrastructure is under advanced monitoring with 24/7 technical support, backups and alerts.
