# How to delegate your AVAX using Avalanche wallet

Avalabs has just launched its main network so AVAX holders can now participate in staking and earn rewards.

> Please keep in mind that the data in the screenshots are taken from the test network.

## What do I need to do to start delegating my AVAX? 
At the time of writing the only known wallet that will support AVAX delegation immediately after Everest starts is the official Avalanche wallet. If you participated in the public sale of Avalanche tokens, you might already have a wallet and certain amount of AVAX (that also could be delegated despite it's locked up) if not, you need to create the wallet first.  

## Create your Avalanche wallet 
1. Go to the https://wallet.avax.network/
2. Choose the `Create new wallet` option.
3. Generate a 24 word key phrase for your wallet. Please be very careful since this phrase is the only way to keep control of your AVAX. 
4. Once the wallet is ready you can deposit AVAX to start delegation.

> We recommend using the keystore file which is an encrypted version of a private key protected by your password, since itâ€™s secure and convenient to use.

## Delegate your AVAX to a pool
1. Open your wallet using the key phrase or keystore file.

4. Go to the `Earn` tab and use `Cross Chain Transfer` to send the necessary amount of AVAX to the Platform chain (P-Chain) to make the delegation possible.  Please keep in mind that the minimum amount for delegation is 25 AVAX.

5. Once you see the correct amount of AVAX under the P-Chain, you can proceed with the delegation by clicking the `Add Delegator` button.

6. Now you have to choose a pool to delegate with. To stake with P2P you will need a P2P Pool ID. Please let us know if you want to stake with us and we send you the ID after the Avalanche mainnet launch.
7. Click the `Select` button.

## How to track the delegated stake?
Although the Avalanche web wallet looks great and easy to use, there is no possibility to see the delegation history. Fortunately however, there is an official [explorer](https://explorer.avax.network/) where you can quickly find some data.
